Used for cases where the data is not linearly seperable.

Mapping Data to a higher Dimension:
1. Adding dimensionality(mapping function) to data to convert not-linearly seperable data to linearly seperable data 
2. But this is computationally intensive

KERNELS:  Website- http://mlkernels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kernels.html 
Concept: Select a landmark in the data and depending on the distance from the landmark, results are claculated
Popular Types:
1. Gaussian Radial Basis Function(RBF) kernel: (View the attached image)
    Perform higher dimensional computations for non-linear data effectively without the need for computer intensive operation
2. Sigmoid kernel
3. Polynomial kernel

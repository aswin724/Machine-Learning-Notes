1. SVM works to find the best decision line that can split the data.
2. It is found using the Maximum margin. The line that is at Maximum distance from the support Vectors.
3. Suppport vectors/points are the only points that matter for creating the decision line for the model.
4. Support Vecotrs are the point that are most difficult to classify

How is SVM different from other models?
ANSWER:
Most of the algos learn how MOST of the data points are(ie.common data points). 
SVM looks at the near extreme of the data (points close to the classification boundary)

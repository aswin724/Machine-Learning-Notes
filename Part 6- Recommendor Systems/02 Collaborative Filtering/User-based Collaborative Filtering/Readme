User-based Collaborative filtering in R- 
Webinar notes- https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=collaborative+filtering+in+r

It is a technique of grouping customers by their buying preferences.
ASSUMPTION- Users with similar preferences will rate items similarly 

BASIC IDEAS:
For a given customer A:
a. Find a set of customers who have purchased/rated similar items in the past 
b. Aggregate the items bought by these similar customers
c. Eliminate the item the user has laready purchased/rated
d. Present the rest of the items.

Steps for Implementation:
1. Data prep- 
  a. Rather than getting the affinity of the user towards product by asking explicitly, we measure it by user-behaviour from the data 
  b. Create a list of metrics that can help identify the user behaviour, and give a relative weight for each of theose behaviour to calculate the final affinity 
  c. Metrics example- Add to cart, Add to wish list, Zoomed Product image, Repeat page views of product details page, Recency(Days since last visit)
  d. Create USERID, ITEMID matrix

2. Model creation (user based)--- use "UBCF"

3. Similarity weights/ k-NN, Cosine similarity--- to find similar group of users 
  a. Cosine similarity measure: The smaller the angle b/w the user rating vectors, the similar they are
    a.1.  Formula:  similairty(X,Y) where X,Y are user rating vectors= cos theta = X.Y/(mod(X)*mod(Y))
  b. Then use KNN to get the ideal count of similar users 
  
4. Predict
  a. Predict for missing ratings of active user -- average of the ratings given by similar users 
  b. top N-predictions for each user 
  
5. Evaluate accuracy - RMSE, Mean of Average Error

Collaborative Filtering algorithm considers “User Behaviour” for recommending items. 
They exploit behaviour of other users and items in terms of transaction history, ratings, selection and purchase information. 
Other users behaviour and preferences over the items are used to recommend items to the new users. 
In this case, features of the items are not known.

Stpes:
1. create a matrix of user features for each user (U)
2. Create another matrix of item ratings by each user
3. From the matrix, by formaing quations for each user rating(ie. Transpose(U)*Item Feature matrix), we'll get eqns (No.of.eqn= no.of users who rated the product)
4. Solve these eqns for getting the feature matrix of the item. Repeat for all items
5. Recommender items for each user formula: MAX(U1TS1, U1TS2, U1TS3, U1TS4, U1TS5)

Assumptions of Simple linear regression:

1. Linear relationship.
2. Multivariate normality.
3. No or little multicollinearity.
4. No auto-correlation.
5. Homoscedasticity.(Same varinace for all predictor variables from the regression line. Around the line, the predictors shuld not be concentrated on one side and scattered on the other)


Ordinary Least squares:
Aim--- To find the mininum of SUM OF SQUARES(IE sum(y-yhat)^2)

Note- In Python for Simple Linear Regression, the library takes care of FEATURE SCALING

Assumptions - Mostly same as that of simple linear regression

In case of categorical variables- Dummy variable trap:
If we include all the dummy variables say 'n', there will be multi collinearity. So use n-1

Frame work:
5 types:
1. All in (not recommended, only if sure of variables)
2. Backward elimination (Fastest of all iterative models)
3. Forward selection 
4. Bidirectional Elimination/stepwise regression (perform iterations of forward selection followed by backward elimination)
5. Score comparison/all possible models -- Most resource consuming 
  -- Select a goodness of fit criterion
  --  build all possible combination of models ((2^N)-1)
  -- choose the one with the best criterion

It has 3 parts:
1. Support 
2. Confidence
3. Lift

Support: (support for a particular item/combo in total transaction)
1. Market basket optimisation : Support for an Item combo=Support(I2&I1) = # transactins having item I2 and I1 / Total # transactions
2. Movie recommendations: Support(Movie2 and Movie2) = # watchlists having movie M2 and M1 / Total # watchlists

Confidence: = find prob. of people getting Y after getting X
1. Market basket optimisation : Confidence(I1 to I2)=Support(I1 to I2)/ Support(I1)
2. Movie recommendations: Confidence(M1 to M2)=Support(M1 to M2)/ Support(M1)

Lift= Finding the prob. of Y when useres do X, while controlling for popularity if Y (or Confidence/Support  (not used))


Steps:
1. Set a minimum support and confidence (look in the code for explanation)  
   Minimum Support- Depends on products that makes business sense and meaningful impact 
2. Take all subsets in transactions having support higher than minimum support
3. Take all the rules of these subsets having higher confidence than min.confidence
4. Sort the rules by decreasing lift

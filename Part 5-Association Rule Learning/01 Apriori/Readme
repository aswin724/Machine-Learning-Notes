It has 3 parts:
1. Support 
2. Confidence
3. Lift

Support: (support for a particular item in total transaction)
1. Market basket optimisation : Support for an Item=Support(I2) = # transactins having item I2 / Total # transactions
2. Movie recommendations: Support(Movie2) = # watchlists having movie M2 / Total # watchlists

Confidence:
1. Market basket optimisation :Confidence(I1 to I2) = # transactins having item I1 and I2 / Total # transactions having I1
2. Movie recommendations: Confidence(M1 to M2) = # watchlists having movie M1 and M2 / Total # watchlists having Movie 1

Lift= Confidence/Support ---- Improvement from the random selection


Steps:
1. Set a minimum support and confidence (look in the code for explanation)  
   Minimum Support- Depends on products that makes business sense and meaningful impact 
2. Take all subsets in transactions having support higher than minimum support
3. Take all the rules of these subsets having higher confidence than min.confidence
4. Sort the rules by decreasing lift

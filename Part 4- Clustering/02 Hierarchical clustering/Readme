There are 2 types of Hierarchical clustering:
1. Agglomerative(bottom up approach)
2. Divisive(Top down approach)

Agglomerative clustering:
Steps:
1. Make each data point a cluster
2. Take the two closest data points and make them a cluster
3. Take 2 'closest' clusters and make them one cluster
4. Repeat the process till we have a one huge cluster left.
5. The entire process is stored in the form of DENDOGRAMS
6. Set a threshold 'Eucledian' distance above which clusters cannot be formed. 
7. The number of vertical lines crossing the threshold line gives the number of final clusters according to the threshold

Note: In Python,we use 'ward' linkage as a function to 'minimise the within cluster variance'

Optimal Clusters:
Find the largest vertical line that does not cross any horizontal line and take a cut below that 

How do Dendograms work?
X-axis= Each data point in space
Y-axis= Eucledian distance. It represents the dissimilarity b/w the points. Greater the distance, more the dissimilarity

There are 2 types of Hierarchical clustering:
1. Agglomerative(Top down)
2. Divisive(Bottom up)

Agglomerative clustering:
Steps:
1. Make each data point a cluster
2. Take the two closest data points and make them a cluster
3. Take 2 'closest' clusters and make them one cluster
4. Repeat the process till we have a one huge cluster left.
